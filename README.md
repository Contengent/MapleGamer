# MapleGamer
I will be working on a bot for maplestory written in python that is used to play the game based off of a given routine created in an csv file.
All current features will be crossed out from the lists below, they are not in any particular order of priorty outside of their grouping.

# Priority features of the bot:
- ~~Rotating through given routine~~
- ~~Automatic movement to specific cordinates~~
- Auto buffing and auto pet feeding

# Future features:
- Discord notifs of events (rune, players, etc.)
- Solving runes by sending discord messages
- Runesolver (Every type of rune)
- Eliteboss killing
- Eliteboss box opener
- GUI
- Lie dectector detection
- Whiteroom check
- player state recognition
- auto loot rotation

# End goal (in order probably)
- Automating dailies/weeklies
- Automate level 30->200
- Auto bossing
- Farming AI
- To have Nexon re-write all of maplestory, but better

# Reasoning?
Because my github has nothing but "rule34 ranker" and it's still an incomplete repository
