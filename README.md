# MapleGamer
I will be working on a bot for maplestory written in python that is used to play the game based off of a given routine created in an csv file.

# Current features:
- none, I'm going to sleep after I upload all of this.

# Priority features of the bot:
- Rotating through given routine
- Automatic movement to certain cordinates
- Auto buffing and auto pet feeding
- Discord notifs of events (rune, players, etc.)

# Future features:
- Solving runes by sending discord messages
- Runesolver (Every type of rune)
- Eliteboss killing
- Eliteboss box opener
- GUI


# Reasoning?
The reasons I want to create this bot is because I am struggling to use bots made by other people. They are frustratingly hard to debug since I am not familiar with all the innerworkings of their bot, and no matter how hard I try, I never seem to be able to fully understand it all because of how un-nessecarily large the codebases are.
Another reason I am working on this is because my github has been looking quite barren as of late. It's not that I haven't been coding, but more that nothing that I coded was worth putting on my public github, or is a private project, (Maplestory 1.5 coming soon to a steam store near you) and I believe that maplestory is a game made 100x more enjoyable when it is just 'the fun parts,' ie. Cubing, bossing, and talking with others. Not farming for hours upon hours just to level up once.
